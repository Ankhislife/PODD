# eXpress

This repository contains code for the Android application eXpress. The application was created by Daniel Koronthaly as part of undergraduate research at Western Washington University.
The application is intended to provide non-verbal autistic children a communication tool that they can use to express their feelings.
It provides the capability of navigating to feelings pages where each page contains:
* The name of the feeling
* A customizable emoji representing the feeling
* A button to say the name of the feeling
* A button to play a tune associated with the feeling
